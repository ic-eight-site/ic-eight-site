      <h2>How We Can Help</h2>
      <p>Translation alone doesn’t make your product usable. We find what’s blocking Japanese adoption and fix only what matters.</p>

      <h3>When your product sounds unsure in Japanese</h3>
      <p>Even good GPT output can feel weak or untrustworthy. We rewrite AI‑generated Japanese into confident, human-quality UX language.</p>

      <h3>When English logic breaks in Japanese</h3>
      <p>Literal translations often fail when English UX patterns don’t map to Japanese. We reshape the content to match Japanese expectations without breaking your design.</p>

      <h3>When onboarding causes drop‑off</h3>
      <p>Japanese users tend to disengage when instructions are vague or awkward. We optimize Japanese onboarding copy so users know what to do and why it matters.</p>

      <h3>When your Help content feels robotic</h3>
      <p>GPT‑translated help can confuse users more than it helps. We rewrite high-priority Help flows so they sound clear, natural, and truly helpful.</p>

      <h3>When your customer stories fall flat</h3>
      <p>Literal translation often makes great stories feel bland. We localize Japanese case studies with narrative sensitivity so they inspire trust.</p>

    <section id="start-review">
      <h2>Start with a Japanese UX Review</h2>
      <p>A clear, concise review of how your product feels to Japanese users. We identify friction: trust issues, confusing UI wording, missing help, broken onboarding, unclear feature discovery.</p>
      <p>This review is diagnostic by design. You can implement the fixes internally, or ask IC Eight to handle specific items.</p>
