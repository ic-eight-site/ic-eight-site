  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p class="lead sub">Focused support for teams entering — or struggling with — the Japanese market.</p>
  <p>IC Eight offers a small set of services designed to improve adoption, clarity, and trust.  
  Each engagement adapts to what your product actually needs — not to a checklist or a translation quota.</p>

<section>
  <h2>1. Japanese UX Review</h2>
  <p>A clear, concise review of how your current product feels to Japanese users.  
  We highlight where confidence drops, where misunderstandings happen, and where the experience creates friction — across UI, onboarding, help access, and feature discovery.</p>
  <p>Quick, actionable insights without heavy implementation work.</p>
  <div class="hr"></div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Content Tone Rebuild</h2>
  <p>Rewriting key messaging so it works for Japanese decision-makers.  
  This isn’t translation — it’s language strategy.</p>
  <p>We redesign copy so benefits, risks, and intent land clearly in Japanese.  
  Useful for landing pages, product pages, email flows, and any place where tone affects adoption.</p>
  <div class="hr"></div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Japanese Product Readiness Audit</h2>
  <p>A structured evaluation of your product’s readiness for Japan.  
  We review onboarding, help content, tutorials, templates, release notes, terminology, and trust signals.</p>
  <p>The result is a prioritized plan: what to fix now, what can wait, and what will actually shift adoption.</p>
  <p>The audit is detailed but pragmatic — designed for teams that want clarity, not a 60-page report.</p>
  <div class="hr"></div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. AI-Assisted Localization Direction</h2>
  <p>For teams already using GPT, DeepL, or internal LLM workflows.  
  We define what can be automated, what cannot, and how to build Japanese output that doesn’t break UX.</p>
  <p>This includes guardrails, prompt structures, terminology guidance, and quality thresholds tailored to your product.</p>

<section>
  <h2>5. Full Localization Package (EN → JA)</h2>
  <p>Translation done when it matters — as part of building a coherent Japanese experience.  
  This package includes the UX perspective from above services and ensures Japanese output that feels written, intentional, and ready for adoption.</p>
  <p>AI-generated drafts can be incorporated. DeepL-style output often requires full rewriting.</p>

  <h2>Not sure where to start?</h2>
  <p>The easiest entry point is a Japanese UX Review.  
  You’ll see immediately where language is blocking adoption — and what the next steps should be.</p>
