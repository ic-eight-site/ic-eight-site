    <details open>
      <summary>What makes IC Eight different from other localization vendors?</summary>
      <p>We work directly with clients — no middle layers, no generic templates. Every project is handled by a single localization writer, ensuring tone and clarity stay intact.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you use AI tools?</summary>
      <p>Yes, when they enhance clarity and efficiency — never at the cost of human judgment or voice.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What kind of AI do you use?</summary>
      <p>We use different AI tools depending on the project — mainly for research, tone calibration, and draft review. If you’re curious how we think about machine translation and AI-assisted work, here’s a detailed look:<br>

    <details>
      <summary>What if our team doesn’t have a localization manager?</summary>
      <p>That’s totally fine — most early-stage teams don’t.
      We can help you design a lightweight workflow that fits your current setup, so you don’t need to hire a full PM or adopt a complex TMS. If you already have someone handling vendors, we’ll make sure the process integrates smoothly with theirs</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you manage projects, too?</summary>
      <p>Not in the traditional “project-manager” sense.<br>
      Instead, I focus on making the workflow self-sustaining and maintaining tone, terminology, and consistency across all deliverables — which often means there’s less to manage in the first place.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>We’re planning multilingual localization. Can you work as part of a global team?</summary>
      <p>Yes — that’s our focus. But we can refer you to trusted partners for other Tier 1 languages if needed.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you handle only Japanese localization?</summary>
      <p>Yes. We often collaborate as the Japanese specialists within multilingual localization teams — working alongside English, Spanish, and French counterparts to keep tone and terminology aligned.
      If your other language partners already have established workflows, we can adapt easily to that structure, or help document the Japanese workflow as a reference model for other languages.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why don’t most companies hire freelancers directly instead of using vendors?</summary>
      <p>Usually not because of quality — but logistics.<br>
    Paying and managing multiple freelancers across different countries means handling separate contracts, NDAs, currencies, and invoices.<br>
    We simplify that: IC Eight operates as a registered business that can work directly with you, handle compliance and invoicing cleanly, and still keep the creative process transparent.</p>
