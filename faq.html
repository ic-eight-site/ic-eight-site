    <div class="hr"></div>

    <details open>
      <summary>Do you need our product to be fully built before we start?</summary>
      <p>No. We can begin from early prototypes, staging environments, or even screenshots. If nothing is localized yet, we help identify the highest-impact entry points for Japanese users.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if we don’t have any Japanese version at all?</summary>
      <p>That’s normal. We start with the parts of the product that actually drive adoption — onboarding, help, tutorials, and UX copy — not only UI strings.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you work with AI-generated Japanese drafts?</summary>
      <p>Yes. If the draft comes from GPT-level tools, we can refine it into coherent, natural Japanese. If the draft comes from DeepL or sentence-by-sentence MT, we usually rebuild it — the structure doesn’t carry over.
      If you’re curious how we think about machine translation and AI-assisted work, here’s a detailed look:<br>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you need access to the live product?</summary>
      <p>Ideally, yes. Having access lets us fix friction at the interaction level. If that’s not possible, we can work with screenshots, screen recordings, or a staging environment. Post-launch reviews also work.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if our team doesn’t have a localization manager?</summary>
      <p>Most early-stage teams don’t. We work directly with your PM, content lead, or founder. The workflow is simple and doesn’t require a TMS or heavy management.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you collaborate as part of a multilingual release?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Japanese is our core focus, but we can collaborate within multilingual teams when needed. We work with trusted partners for Brazilian Portuguese — the variant most SaaS teams prioritize — and we can connect you with vetted specialists for other Tier-1 languages on request.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you handle UX/UI copy, help, tutorials, and onboarding?</summary>
      <p>Yes. These are often even more important than UI strings when it comes to Japanese adoption. We cover all parts of the user journey where language affects understanding.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do you ensure tone and consistency?</summary>
      <p>We maintain a single Japanese voice across UI, help, onboarding, and marketing. If you already have English voice guidelines, we adapt them. If not, we can create lightweight tone notes based on your product style.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you review our existing Japanese version?</summary>
      <p>Yes. We can run a full Japanese UX audit and flag trust-breaking issues, unclear flows, or mismatched tone.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How is pricing handled?</summary>
      <p>We don’t publish price tables because every engagement is scope-specific. For translation or rewriting work, we typically price per word. For audits, reviews, or structured reports, we price per deliverable.<br>All pricing is quoted upfront — no surprises.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you sign NDAs and handle invoicing internationally?</summary>
      <p>Yes. IC Eight operates as a registered business and can work directly with international teams, including NDAs, compliance, and clean invoicing.</p>
