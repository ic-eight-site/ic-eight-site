      <summary>What makes IC Eight different from other localization vendors?</summary>
      <p>We work directly with clients — no middle layers, no generic templates. Every project is handled by a single localization writer, ensuring tone and clarity stay intact.</p>

      <summary>What if our team doesn’t have a localization manager?</summary>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you handle only Japanese localization?</summary>
      <p>Yes — that’s our focus. But we can refer you to trusted partners for other Tier 1 languages if needed.</p>
