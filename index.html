  <!-- Slide 2 — What We Do -->
<section>
  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <p><strong>Clean. Smart. Human.</strong><br>
  IC Eight is a micro-studio offering direct, expert-level English–Japanese translation — enhanced by AI, never diluted by layers.</p>

  <p>No bloated workflows. No middlemen.<br>
  Because the best results come from direct collaboration between client and creator — the one shaping meaning across languages.</p>

  <div class="hr"></div>
</section>

  <!-- Slide 3 — Philosophy -->
 <section>
  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p><strong>Beyond “just another language.”</strong><br>  
  Japanese works very differently from European languages.<br>
  It’s not just about replacing words, but rebuilding tone and rhythm from the ground up.<br>
  We shape meaning so your message truly resonates in Japanese.<br>
  Because what resonates is what people trust.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>IC Eight works as your direct localization partner.<br>
    You share your English content.<br>
    We review tone, intent, and context.<br>

  <!-- Slide 6 — FAQ -->
  <section>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What makes IC Eight different from other localization vendors?</strong><br>
    A: We work directly with clients — no middle layers, no generic templates. Every project is handled by a single localization writer, ensuring tone and clarity stay intact.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Do you use AI tools?</strong><br>
    A: Yes, when they enhance clarity and efficiency — never at the cost of human judgment or voice.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: What kind of AI do you use?</strong><br>
    A: We use different AI tools depending on the project — mainly for research, tone calibration, and draft review.
    If you’re curious how we think about machine translation and AI-assisted work, here’s a detailed look:<br>

    <p>[<a href="faq.html">More questions →</a>]</p>
    <p><strong>Q: What if we don’t have a localization manager?</strong><br>
    A: That’s totally fine — most early-stage teams don’t.<br>
    I can help you design a lightweight workflow that fits your current setup, so you don’t need to hire a full PM or adopt a complex TMS.
    If you already have someone handling vendors, I’ll make sure the process integrates smoothly with theirs</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Do you manage projects, too?</strong><br>
    A: Not in the traditional “project-manager” sense.<br>
    Instead, I focus on making the workflow self-sustaining and maintaining tone, terminology, and consistency across all deliverables — which often means there’s less to manage in the first place.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: We’re planning multilingual localization. Can you work as part of a global team?</strong><br>
    A: Yes. We often collaborate as the Japanese specialists within multilingual localization teams — working alongside English, Spanish, and French counterparts to keep tone and terminology aligned.
    If your other language partners already have established workflows, we can adapt easily to that structure, or help document the Japanese workflow as a reference model for other languages.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Why don’t most companies hire freelancers directly instead of using vendors?</strong><br>
    A: Usually not because of quality — but logistics.<br>
    Paying and managing multiple freelancers across different countries means handling separate contracts, NDAs, currencies, and invoices.<br>
    We simplify that: IC Eight operates as a registered business that can work directly with you, handle compliance and invoicing cleanly, and still keep the creative process transparent.</p>
