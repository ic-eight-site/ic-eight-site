  <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <p class="lead">Not a translation pipeline — a workflow for making your product usable in Japan.</p>
  <div class="hr"></div>

  <p>We rebuild the Japanese layer so your product becomes discoverable, understandable, and trusted by Japanese users.  
  Translation may be part of the work — but the real goal is adoption, not word replacement.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>1. Understand how your product is used</h2>
  <p>We look at your current Japanese layer (if any): UI, onboarding, help, templates, tutorials, release notes.  
  If no Japanese exists yet, we review the English product from the perspective of where Japanese users will feel uncertainty, risk, or friction.</p>

  <p>The goal at this stage: identify where meaning breaks before any translation begins.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>2. Identify what actually improves adoption</h2>
  <p>Most teams assume “UI first.”  
  But in Japan, UI strings rarely drive adoption — tutorials, help, guidance, and onboarding do.</p>

  <p>We map the friction points that stop Japanese users from starting:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Missing or English-only onboarding</li>
    <li>Help and tutorials that don’t explain core value</li>
    <li>Feature announcements users never see</li>
    <li>Inconsistency that erodes trust</li>
    <li>Tone mismatches that make the product feel foreign</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>3. Rebuild the Japanese layer</h2>
  <p>This is where the work becomes translation, rewriting, or restructuring — whichever removes friction fastest.</p>

  <p>Typical components include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Japanese onboarding and feature discovery</li>
    <li>Help-center and tutorial frameworks</li>
    <li>UX copy rework and clarity fixes</li>
    <li>Product terminology alignment</li>
    <li>Templates and in-product guidance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our output is not “Japanese text,” but a Japanese experience.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>4. Ensure coherence across the product</h2>
  <p>We align tone, hierarchy, terminology, and trust signals across every touchpoint — not just the UI.</p>

  <p>Even simple products feel fragmented in Japanese if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>UI is translated but help is not</li>
    <li>Templates remain English-only</li>
    <li>Feature names match but explanations differ</li>
    <li>Announcements or changelogs stay untranslated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Coherence is what makes the product feel intentional in Japanese — and what separates “localized” from “usable.”</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>5. Deliver fast, clean output designed for adoption</h2>
  <p>We deliver Japanese that feels native, consistent, and trustworthy — whether built from scratch or refined from AI-assisted drafts.</p>

  <p>Everything is optimized for one outcome:  
  <strong>Japanese users understand your product without friction.</strong></p>
