  <h1>How IC Eight Works</h1>
  <p class="lead sub">We run the Japanese language layer — stepping in only where words affect trust, clarity, and adoption.</p>
  <p>
    IC Eight operates the Japanese language layer of AI-driven products.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t localize everything. We don’t polish every sentence.
    We step in only where language affects risk perception, user confidence, or adoption behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, we rarely “translate” at all.  
    Instead of fixing machine-generated output, we prompt large language models to write directly in Japanese — optimized for intent, tone, and user confidence from the start.  
    This skips the post-editing loop entirely and delivers UX-native Japanese in one step.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Identify where language creates hesitation or perceived risk</li>
    <li>Decide what is safe to keep as-is and what needs human judgment</li>
    <li>Set guardrails for AI-generated Japanese (criteria, examples, and escalation points)</li>
    <li>Support product teams with lean, practical review loops</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="sub">
    If you want a structured way to internalize Japanese with AI while keeping trust intact,
    this is the layer we focus on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Retainer support is available</strong> for ongoing language operations (lightweight reviews, guardrails, and quick decisions).
    If you prefer one-off work, that’s possible too.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t offer generic MT post-editing.  
    If you already have NMT output, we’re happy to assess it — but we’ll often recommend rethinking how the content is generated in the first place.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="start-review">
  <h2>Start with a Japanese UX Review</h2>
  <p>
    A clear, concise review of how your product feels to Japanese users.
    We identify friction: trust issues, confusing UI wording, missing help, broken onboarding, unclear feature discovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is often useful when a team feels “something is off” with Japanese, but can’t tell where or why.
  </p>
  <p>
    This review is diagnostic by design.
    You can implement the fixes internally, or ask IC Eight to handle specific intervention points.
