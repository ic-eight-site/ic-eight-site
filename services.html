  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p class="lead sub">Practical support for building the Japanese language layer of your product — designed for clarity, trust, and adoption.</p>
  <p>All IC Eight services start from one assumption:  
  translation alone does not create a usable product.  
  We diagnose what blocks Japanese adoption — and fix only what needs fixing.</p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>IC Eight works with teams that care about clarity — not just translation. Typical clients include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product teams</strong> releasing globally and offering early Japanese support.</li>
    <li><strong>EdTech platforms</strong> localizing onboarding, tests, and tutorials.</li>
    <li><strong>AI-first startups</strong> using GPT or DeepL but needing tone control and coherence.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation and help teams</strong> focused on in-product guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>Product-led companies</strong> with Japanese users but no local team.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and CS teams</strong> noticing churn from unclear language UX.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have Japanese users — or want to — IC Eight helps make the experience work.</p>

  <h2>1. Japanese UX Review</h2>
  <p>A clear, concise review of how your product feels to Japanese users.  
  We identify friction: trust issues, confusing UI wording, missing help, broken onboarding, unclear feature discovery.</p>
  <p>This service is diagnostic by design.  
  You can implement the fixes internally, or ask IC Eight to handle specific items.</p>

  <h2>2. Japanese Product Readiness Audit</h2>
  <p>A structured evaluation of your product’s readiness for Japan.  
  We review onboarding flows, help content, tutorials, templates, release notes, terminology, and overall language UX.</p>
  <p>The output is a prioritized plan — what matters now, what can wait, and what will shift adoption.  
  The audit stands alone; execution is optional.</p>

<section>
  <h2>3. Content Tone Rebuild</h2>
  <p>Some products need more than translation — they need a Japanese narrative that connects.
  We rebuild your key content (lead, CTA, headers, summaries) into persuasive, native-quality Japanese that feels written for Japanese users, not translated for them.</p>
  <p><i>Optional: Tone notes or language rationale can be provided upon request.</i></p>

<section>
  <h2>4. AI Localization Guardrails</h2>
  <p>Guidance for teams using GPT or DeepL internally.<br>
  We define what can be automated, what cannot, and how to prevent Japanese output from breaking your UX.</p>

  <p>IC Eight provides guardrails, fail conditions, quality criteria, and lightweight prompts.<br>
  You send the English source; we help your team produce native-feeling Japanese — with light review included where it matters.</p>

  <p>It’s a one-time setup that gives your team confidence — with optional ongoing review for future releases.</p>

  <h2>5. Full Localization Package (EN → JA)</h2>
  <p>Translation only where it matters — as part of building a coherent Japanese experience.  
  This package integrates the UX lens of the services above and delivers adoption-ready Japanese across UI, help, and product content.</p>
  <p>We draw on the right approach for each context — whether it’s copywriting, translation, or UX-first rewriting — to make your product feel intuitive and trustworthy in Japanese.</p>
  <p>AI-generated drafts can be used as input.  
  Outputs like DeepL often require full rewriting.</p>
  <p>Translation is just one tool — used only when it strengthens clarity and trust.</p>
