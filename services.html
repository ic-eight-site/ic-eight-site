  <h1>How IC Eight Works</h1>
  <p class="lead sub">We run the Japanese language layer — stepping in only where words affect trust, clarity, and adoption.</p>
  <p>
    IC Eight operates the Japanese language layer of AI-driven and global products.
    We step in only where wording affects clarity, trust, or adoption.
    When that happens, we choose the most effective approach — sometimes that means translation, other times it means rewriting or restructuring.
    What matters is clarity and user confidence — not word-for-word equivalence.
  </p>

  <p>
    In most cases, we don’t “translate” in the traditional sense. Rather than fixing machine-generated Japanese after the fact, we guide large language models to write directly in Japanese from the beginning, aligned with intent, tone, and user confidence. This avoids the MT post-editing loop entirely and produces UX-native Japanese in one step.
  </p>
</section>

<section>

  <h2>What the work typically looks like</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Identify where language creates hesitation or perceived risk</li>
    <li>Decide what is safe to leave as-is and what needs human judgment</li>
    <li>Set guardrails for AI-generated Japanese (criteria, examples, and escalation points)</li>
    <li>Support product teams with lean, practical review loops</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want a structured way to internalize Japanese with AI while keeping trust intact,
    this is the layer we focus on.
  </p>

</section>

<section>

  <h2>How collaboration usually works</h2>

  <p>This approach works best when the Japanese layer is treated as an ongoing system rather than a one-off translation task.</p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Retainer support is available</strong> for ongoing language operations (lightweight reviews, guardrails, and quick decisions).
    If you prefer one-off work, that’s possible too.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What we don’t do</h2>

  <p>
    We don’t offer MT post-editing. That decision is intentional.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your goal is to “fix” machine-translated Japanese sentence by sentence, there are many vendors who can help with that.
  </p>

  <p>
    IC Eight’s work is different. We design the Japanese language layer so the product already feels clear, trusted, and usable, without relying on MTPE.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If MTPE is what you’re looking for, IC Eight probably isn’t the right fit. And that’s okay.

    In many cases, that means generating the Japanese directly with LLMs, guided by tone, intent, and UX.

<section id="start-review">
  <h2>Start with a Japanese UX Review</h2>
  <p>
    A clear, concise review of how your product feels to Japanese users.
    We identify friction: trust issues, confusing UI wording, missing help, broken onboarding, unclear feature discovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is often useful when a team feels “something is off” with Japanese, but can’t tell where or why.
  </p>
  <p>
    This review is diagnostic by design.
    You can implement the fixes internally, or ask IC Eight to handle specific intervention points.
